`forcontourf(allx::Vector, ally::Vector, xedges, yedges)` returns `xs, ys, zs` for `CairoMakie.contourf!(xs, ys, zs)`.

Noted that `length(xs) + 1` = `length(xedges)`.

# Input argument

- `allx`, `ally` are each a vector of values corrsponding to the X and Y coordinates in the plot, indicating all points on the X-Y plane.
- `xedges`, `yedges` are each a range specifying the edges for calculating 2D histogram.
