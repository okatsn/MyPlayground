# MyPlayground
- MyPlayground is a container for trying anything. 
- Make sure to use branch before doing anything.
- Only the most basic environment setup is done in branch `master`

!!! warning

- Modify only the container building files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, devcontainer.json) at branch **master**; otherwise, it is difficult to maintain.
- That you should build your container at branch master only.
